        <h2>Initiatives for Gender Equality in Flood</h2>
        <p>The Prohora project is committed to promoting gender equality and supporting flood-affected communities by addressing the unique challenges women and gender-diverse individuals face in climate crises. By integrating NASAâ€™s satellite data, IoT technology, and dedicated educational resources, Prohora not only provides real-time flood alerts but also highlights gender-specific issues in disaster response. Our website features a dedicated section on gender equality that raises awareness about these challenges, offering resources and support tailored to empower women and gender-diverse individuals. Through educational campaigns, Prohora emphasizes the critical intersection between gender and climate, advocating for equal participation and representation in community-driven climate action. By fostering informed communities and facilitating direct access to disaster response support, Prohora works to ensure that gender equality remains a core focus in building resilience against climate change.</p>
